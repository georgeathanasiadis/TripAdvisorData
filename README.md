# TripAdvisor-Scraping

#### Analysis of TripAdvisor Data with the help of Selenium, Beautiful Soup and Python

This project is an assignment for the MSc course "Web Data Mining" at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 
In this work, we collect our TripAdvisor data with Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries and store them in a local MongoDB NoSQL database. 
Moreover, we proceed with various preprocessing steps in order to further analyze and visualize the collected data. 
Thus, we unveil data correlations, insights and new knowledge.
